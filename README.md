## Projects

Lung Disease Prediction Web App  
Built a medical ML application using Orange3 and image texture analysis to predict early-stage lung diseases.

Image Caption Generator  
Developed an LSTM-based NLP and computer vision model using PyTorch to generate human-like captions for images.

Crop Yield Prediction  
Developed a TensorFlow regression model to recommend optimal crops using soil and climate data and deployed the application using Gradio for interactive predictions.

Apple Equity Forecast Engine  
Built a stacked LSTM time-series forecasting model to predict AAPL closing prices with preprocessing, scaling, RMSE evaluation, multi-step forecasting, and deployed the model using Streamlit and Hugging Face.

Smart Farming Hub – Plant Disease Detection  
Developed a transfer learning–based CNN model in PyTorch for plant disease classification from leaf images with data augmentation and deployed the application using Gradio.

Blinkit Store Performance Analytics  
Built a comprehensive Power BI financial analytics dashboard to evaluate revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, borrowings, and stock-level performance using balance sheet and income statement data.

Blinkit Retail Sales Dashboard  
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing total sales, outlet performance, item distribution, and customer ratings across locations and outlet types.

League of Legends Esports Analytics  
Built a 3NF MySQL esports analytics warehouse integrating multi-source CSV data with ETL pipelines, analytical views, and stored procedures to compute champion win rates, side advantages, and team performance metrics.

Employee Payroll & HR Analytics Database  
Built a normalized MySQL HR and payroll analytics system integrating multi-table ETL and advanced SQL queries to analyze workforce distribution, compensation structure, leave trends, and departmental salary allocation.
